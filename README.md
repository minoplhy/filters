# Question that i don't know anyone gonna ask me or not
***Q : Why Release ? Why Not Just a simple Repository***

***A : This is to reduce size of main Repository . Bigger Repo Size Longer time to clone Repository . so, to prevent this problem as this problem happened with filters-build . I choose to move all filters files to Release***

***Q : How to clone filters to local***

***A : try release download on github cli***

***Q : Why GitHub Actions not your own machine***

***A : Well, my country's economic is in the worst situation due to pandemic and other thing else . I'm afraid that someday i can't paid Hosting fee and forced to shutdown all my Hosting stuff . so, to reduce damage from that worst case scenario . i'm trying to migrate some of my project's stuff to GitHub Actions, Heroku and somewhere else...***
