# Question that i don't know anyone gonna ask me or not
***Q : Why Wiki ? Why Not Just a simple Repository***

***A : This is to reduce size of main Repository . Bigger Repo Size Longer time to clone Repository . so, to prevent this problem as this problem happened with filters-build . I choose to move all filters files to wiki***

***Q : How to clone filters to local***

***A : clone wiki repo like https://github.com/minoplhy/filters.wiki.git***

***Q : Why GitHub Actions not your own machine***
